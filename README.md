WalletHunter is the only copytrading bot available on the market. Find profitables wallets, and...
- they buy  --> you buy 
- they sell --> you sell

and even better... you frontrun the original Tx :)

&nbsp;

# How does it works?
1/ Find some profitable wallets

2/ Enter them into the bot

3/ Define your strategy :
- Amount (same amount / fraction of original amount...)
- GAS
- HoneyPot check before buy
- etc.

4/ Run the bot
and... that's it !

# Things you need to know
1/ You need a private or semi private node to make it work (because it scans mempool)

2/ As you may know, there are lots and lots of ways to make swaps, and I need to implement them into WalletHunter.
Don't worry, all the usual ways are implemented, but when you find a wallet that you want to copy, send it to me (if it's ok for you) , and I'll tell you if WalletHunter is able to copy it

3/ Only big limitation known today : UniswapV3 Tx are not clonable for now --> I'm working on it

# Who am I?
Iâ€™m the lead dev of LimitSwap, one of the first Crypto Trading bot launched on the market.

LimitSwap is still my #1 project with more than 500 users, along with Sniper Bot, also one of the first Sniping Bot available.
